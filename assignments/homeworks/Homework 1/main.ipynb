A very well-known dataset in statistics is the [*Iris flower dataset*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) collected by Edgar Anderson in 1929. The dataset consists of measurments of iris flowers. Each flower has 4 collected measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, as well as a classification into one of 3 species: *Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor* and *Iris virginica*. We will return to this dataset in the next homework.\n",

    "- `features`: a matrix which has one row per observed flower and one column per measurement.\n",
    "- `targets`: An array that specifies the species of each flower as a number 0-2.\n",
    "- `feature_names`: a list of strings with the name of each measurement.\n",
    "- `target_names`: a list of strings with the name of each species.\n",

    "In this homework, we will only visualize this dataset, which is typically a good first step in working with a new type of data. We'll start by just looking at 2 measurements *sepal length* and *petal length*, along with the species."
